# efficiencydemos

A set of DynamoDB demo scripts and sample data that illustrate the read and write cost of various data access patterns.

## Intro

Amazon DynamoDB is a powerful serverless database that offers virtually unlimited scale when used efficiently.
The table structure and access patterns you choose have a big impact on DynamoDB's efficiency, and ultimately the read and write consumption that you are billed for.
Knowing the best access patterns takes practice and experimentation.  
In these labs, you can run a series of DynamoDB data operations using the AWS Command Line Interface, 
and get immediate visibility into the cost and effectiveness of your calls.

## Pre-requisites

 * An AWS Account with administrator access
 * The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) setup and configured
 * [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for loading the sample data
 * A bash command-line environment such as Mac Terminal or Windows 10 bash shell
 
 *If you do not have an AWS account, you can run [DynamoDB Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html) on your laptop instead.*
 
## Scenario

We are consultants who have been hired to build a shopping cart for an E-commerce website.
Each cart that is created has a unique ID, such as Cart1 or Cart2. Within each cart, one or many products can exist.  
Each product is identified via IDs such as Product100, Product200, etc.
A one-to-many pattern of cart to products is modeled in a DynamoDB table called **ShoppingCart**.

![Cart1](https://dynamodb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/img/cart1.png)

This table also contains other types of items, such as Customer details and Product details.
The Description attribute for many of these items is a large string of 20,000 bytes, representing a typical JSON document payload.

![Customer](https://dynamodb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/img/customer.png)

![Product100](https://dynamodb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/img/product100.png)


We will take a tour of the DynamoDB read and write operations using simple shell scripts that access this table.

## Consumed Capacity

![Consumed Capacity](https://dynamodb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/img/consumed.png)

A nice feature of calls to DynamoDB is that you can request a summary of the capacity consumed by your call.
Even if your call is only sending or receiving a small amount of data, it may be consuming a much larger amount of Read Capacity or Write Capacity.

Capacity is measured in Read Units and Write Units (sometimes called RCUs and WCUs).
Each read unit represents the size of data read, measured in 4 KB units. Each write unit represents the size of data written measured in 1 KB units.  Your actual consumption is rounded up to the nearest unit.

Data operations to DynamoDB have an optional "Return Consumed Capacity" parameter, where you can specify either TOTAL or INDEXES.   Specifying INDEXES will provide a total along with a breakdown of capacity consumed by indexes.

For reads, you will also see two counts returned, the Scanned Count and the Returned Count.
The Scanned Count is the total number of Items (rows) read by the DynamoDB engine, while the Returned Count is the number returned to the user.


## Setup Steps

1. Clone this repository to a folder on your laptop, or download to a working folder via the green button above.
1. From your command prompt, navigate to the cart folder: ```cd cart```
1. You may wish to run ```export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)``` so that scripts in your current folder will be added to your path.
1. Verify the AWS CLI is setup and running by running ```aws sts get-caller-identity``` 
and ```aws dynamodb describe-limits```.  You should see no errors.
1. Verify your AWS CLI is pointing to default region **us-east-1** (N. Virginia) by running ```aws configure``` and pressing enter four times.  You may enter ```us-east-1``` on the third prompt if necessary.

#### Creating the ShoppingCart table
1. Run ```recreate.sh``` to create your table.  Please ignore the ResourceNotFoundException that appears the first time, as it attempts to delete the table should it already exist.
1. Run ```node load``` which will write the data to your new **ShoppingCart** table from the [CartData.csv](./cart/CartData.csv) file.

## Running the Demos
    
This sequence of commands helps illustrate the pros and cons of various access patterns.
As you run each example, try and estimate the capacity you think will be consumed, before running each commmand. 


| Demo | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Scan | ```scan.sh``` |
| Scan with filter | ```scanfilter.sh Cart1``` |
| GetItem Eventual Consistency | ```get.sh Cart1 Product100``` |
| GetItem with projection expression | ```get.sh Cart1 Product100 Price``` |
| GetItem with Strong Consistency | ```get.sh Cart1 Product100 Price STRONG``` |
| BatchGetItem | ```batchget.sh``` |
| Query | ```query.sh Cart1``` |
| Query with Filter | ```queryfilter.sh Cart1 Orange``` |
| Query with Sort Key Expression | ```queryfilter.sh Cart1 Product400``` |
| Delete Item | ```delete.sh Cart1 Product500``` |
| Put Item | ```put.sh``` <br/> *writes new item Cart7 Product700* |
| UpdateItem | 1. ```update.sh Cart7 Product700 Price 22.33``` <br/> 2. ```update.sh Cart7 Product700 CustomerDescription MuchSmaller``` <br/> 3. ```update.sh Cart7 Product700 Price 44.55``` |
| Add New GSI (ProductName + Price) | ```addgsi.sh``` <br/> Wait a couple minutes for **GSI-ProductPrice** to be created. |
| UpdateItem GSI key attribute | ```update.sh Cart1 Product100 Price 12.34``` |
| UpdateItem non-GSI key attribute | ```update.sh Cart1 Product100 Qty 5``` |
| UpdateItem with cost and non-GSI attribute | ```update.sh Customer "John Stiles" Address "100 Main Street"``` |
| Scan a GSI (works the same as base table) | ```scangsi.sh GSI-ProductPrice``` |
| Query a GSI (works the same as base table) | ```querygsi.sh GSI-ProductPrice Turnip``` |
| Write to a GSI | *N/A <br/> you can only write to base table!* |
| Get Item from GSI | *N/A <br/> you can only get item from base table!* |



## Next Steps
The table you created has 17 items and a size of 282 KB.  It was created in **On Demand** capacity mode.
The [pricing page for DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/) shows that you enjoy 25GB of free-tier storage for your tables.
On On Demand mode, you are billed one penny for each 40,000 read units or 8000 write units consumed.
You can delete your table if desired.
